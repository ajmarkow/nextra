# Commands

There are three commands for snippet_cli

``` snippet_cli setup```
    ```snippet_cli new```
    ```snippet_cli help```

## Setup
 Run **snippet_cli setup** if you've just installed the gem, or your snippet_cli_config.txt file has been deleted.  This command writes a config file that tells snippet_cli where to find your snippets yaml file to write new snippets to it.

## New
 Run **snippet_cli new** whenever you'd like to add a new snippet to your espanso configuration.  This will launch a dialog that asks you a few questions to set the snippet.
  - The trigger you choose will automatically have a colon : prepended to it.
  - There is also an option in the dialog to use snippet_cli to add a snippet which invokes a form on your computer
  - Indentation will be maintained once you copy text into the replacement text field in your terminal.
  - Hit Ctrl + D to exit the dialog once you're finished.

## Help
Run **snippet_cli** help if you want to find out where to send any feedback or find documentation about the gem.
