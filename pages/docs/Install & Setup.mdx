### Setup

- The first time running after install you'll need to run the command ```snippet_cli setup```.
- Running this command you'll be presented with a dialog that will write a short file that tells snippet_cli what file to add snippets to.

The defaults are as follows: 
  Reference https://espanso.org/docs/configuration/

<Bleed>
  - Linux: 
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/espanso (e.g. /home/user/.config/espanso)
  - macOS: 
      $HOME/Library/Preferences/espanso (e.g. /Users/user/Library/Preferences/espanso)
  - Windows: 
      \Roaming\AppData\espanso (e.g. C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\espanso)
    
</Bleed>

- Follow along with the brief dialog and the dialog will tell you when the configuration has been added.  
- Then you'll be all set to add snippets to your espanso config using the ```snippet new``` command.
