# Snippet CLI

** Snippet CLI** is a command line based interface for quickly adding snippets to a YAML file.  
Snippet CLI is intended to be used with Espanso, a text expander program which takes YAML files as input.  

These docs cover initial setup, using the command line interface to add snippets, and the options to generate forms using the cli.
